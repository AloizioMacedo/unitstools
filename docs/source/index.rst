Welcome to Unitstools's documentation!
======================================

**Unitstools** is a Python library that helps scientists,
programmers and enthusiats to better manage units of measurement in code via
static typing.

This package makes it more difficult for magic constants that actually
have units to silently live in the code preventing things like a sustainable
units conversion for example.
